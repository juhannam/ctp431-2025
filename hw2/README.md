# Homework #2: Making Simple Music from Zero Using Python

The goal of this homework assignment is to create a music piece using basic sound synthesis units (oscillators, filters, and envelopes) without any audio samples. The length of the song should be around 10 seconds.  

## Due date and deliverables
- **Oct 3, 11:59pm **
- Deliverables: report (.pdf), source code (.ipynb), and audio file (.wav) 
- Make a zip file and submit it to KLMS.


## Step #1: Make your own rhythm track (30pts)
Modify the parameters of sound synthesis units in the <a href="https://github.com/juhannam/ctp431-2025/blob/main/python/04.%20Drum%20Machine.ipynb"> 04. Drum Machine.ipynb </a> 
- Timbre of kick snare, and hi-hat: amp envelope, lowpass filter
- Pattern of rhythm sequeces
- Tempo 
- Anything else (e.g., change the relative volume of each drum event) 

## Step #2: Make your own melody tone (40pts)
Modify the parameters of sound synthesis units in the <a href="https://github.com/juhannam/ctp431-2025/blob/main/python/03.%20Subtractive%20Synthesis.ipynb"> 03. Subtractive Synthesis.ipynb </a> and <a href="https://github.com/juhannam/ctp431-2025/blob/main/python/05.%20RM%2C%20FM%2C%20and%20Non-linear%20Synthesis.ipynb"> 05. RM, FM, and Non-linear Synthesis.ipynb</a>
- Oscillator: oscillator type, the number of oscillators with detune
- Modulation: carrier/modulator ratio, beta (FM)
- Filters: filter type, filer envelope (issue: the filter cut-off frequency should be adjusted by the oscillator frequency?)
- Amp: amplitude envelope
- Audio Effects: Delay-based Effects, Reverberation, Wah-Wah
- Anything else (e.g., vibrato, pitch glide)

## Step #3: Make your own melody line and mix it with your rhythm track  (30pts)
- You may use other instuments (e.g., piano or guitar) while composing the melody 
- Adjust the mixing gains of the melody and rhythm tracks 

## Options (extra 10 pts)
- You can add more tracks such as bass and chords
