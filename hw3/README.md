# Homework #3: Adding Digital Audio Effect to Your Music

The goal of this homework assignment is to improve the overall quality of music made in Homework #2 by adding audio effects to each audio track and mixing them.   

## Due date and deliverables
- **Oct 26, 11:59pm**
- Deliverables: report (.pdf), Audacity file (aup3, aup3-wal, aup3-shm), stereo mix file (.mp3), and source code (.ipynb) (.ipynb files are optional) 
- Make a zip file and submit it to KLMS.

## Step #1: Applying audio effects to audio tracks  
- Load individual instrument tracks (drum, melody, and more) as separate tracks in Audacity 
- Choose an audio effect (EQ, Distortion, Reverb, and more) and apply it to the tracks  
- Adjust audio effect parameters until you find a satisfying setup
- You can also apply the audio effects in <a href="https://github.com/juhannam/ctp431-2025/blob/main/python/06.%20Digital%20Filters.ipynb"> 06. Digital Filters.ipynb </a> and <a href="https://github.com/juhannam/ctp431-2025/blob/main/python/07.%20Delay-based%20Audio%20Effects.ipynb"> 07. Delay-based Audio Effects.ipynb </a> before loading the audio file in Audacity

## Step #2: Mixing gain, Panning, and Mix-down  
- Adjust the volumne gain and panning value of individual tracks until you feel all tracks are well balanced
- Mix down the tracks to a new stereo track
- Export the stereo track as an mp3 file.
