# Homework #1: Observing Sounds through the Lens of Fourier Analysis
The goal of this homework assignment is to observe audio files using Fourier Transforms and match what you see with what you hear. 

## Due date and deliverables
- **Oct 1 (Tue), 11:59pm**
- Deliverables: report (.pdf), source code (.ipynb), and audio file (.wav) 
- Make a zip file and submit it to KLMS.


## Problem #1: Instrumental Sounds (50 pts.)
Plot the waveform, spectrum, and spectrogram of the provided musical instrument samples (guitar, trumpet, vibraphone, kick drum, and snare drum). 

1. Identify the pitch in note number (e.g. C#3, A4) except for the two drum samples. 

2. Describe the timbre with the following attributes:
    - Amplitude envelope  
    - Spectral envelope 
    - Changes of spectral envelope and fundamental frequency
    - Harmonicity: the range between tonal and noise-like character 
    - The onset of a sound differing notably from the sustained vibration
    - Inharmonicity

Note that you can adjust the window size to change the time/frequency resolutions of the spectrogram.

## Problem #2: Music (20 pts.)
Plot the spectrogram of the provided music track (095_Coffee_House_10s) with Audacity. Analyze it while listening to the music. 

1. How many instruments do you hear? Identify the names of the instruments.

2. Verify your answer by separating the mixed track into individual sound sources. You can do this with Gaudio Studio, the AI-powered music source separation service (https://studio.gaudiolab.io/). Note that the free credit is limited to 10 minutes. 


## Problem #3: Your Choice of Sound (30 pts.)
Now, you are going to analyze your own choice of sound. It can be a voice (e.g., speaking or singing), musical instrument, sound effects,everyday sound (e.g., birds, wind, walking, cars), or anything else. The length should be less than 10 seconds long. You can record the sound with your mobile phone or download it from the Internet.

1. Why did you choose the sound?

2. Plot the spectrogram with Audacity. Analyze it while listening to the sound. Describe what you find interesting.
